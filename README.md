## **Data**
There are 3 different datasources involved:
- A pool **Database**. 
- An **API** with information about the jobs of the participants in the poll.
- A list from all the EU related countries **web scraped** from Eurostat.


## **Inputs:**
Two inputs are needed to run the pipeline: the first one is the path where you have stored the database, and the second one a country from the EU.
